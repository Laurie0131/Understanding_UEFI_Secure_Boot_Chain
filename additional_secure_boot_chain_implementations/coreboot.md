## coreboot {#coreboot}

The open source [coreboot](https://coreboot.org) firmware project implements [verified boot](https://doc.coreboot.org/security/vboot/index.html?highlight=verified%20boot), which is similar to a combination of OBB verification and UEFI Secure Boot.

Figure 3-2 shows the verified boot flow. Table 3-2 shows keys used in the verified boot flow.
