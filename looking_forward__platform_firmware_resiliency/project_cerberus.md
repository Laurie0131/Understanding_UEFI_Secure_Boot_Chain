## Project Cerberus {#project-cerberus}

As part of the Open Compute Project (OCP), Project Cerberus defines a hierarchical Root of Trust (RoT) architecture. All active components are required to support both hardware and firmware combined identifing through the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE).

Figure 4-3 thru 4-6 describe the power on sequence, boot flow, recovery flow, and firmware update flow.

The concept of Cerberus is similar to Intel® Boot Guard., but there are several key differences:

1.  Intel® Boot Guard uses Microcode as RoT, while Cerberus uses a dedicated RoT device.
2.  Intel® Boot Guard can mitigate hardware bus attacks.
3.  Intel® Boot Guard only verifies the host system firmware, while Cerberus verifies all boot firmware (platform firmware, BMC, etc.)
4.  Cerberus defines a detailed flow for update and recovery.
